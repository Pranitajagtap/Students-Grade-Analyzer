# Student Grades Analyzer using Python & Pandas

Description:
This project simulates and analyzes student academic performance across multiple subjects using Python. It demonstrates the use of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques with pandas and numpy.

Key Features:

Generates synthetic data for 1,000 students across 8 subjects.

Computes average scores and assigns grades based on performance.

Provides class-level statistics such as overall average, highest & lowest averages, and grade distribution.

Generates subject-level statistics, including descriptive stats and correlation analysis.

Identifies top and bottom performers for deeper insights.

Detects subjects with highest average scores and subjects with the most fails.

Exports clean data to CSV for further analysis or reporting.

Technologies & Libraries:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Potential Applications:

Educational data analysis and reporting.

Performance tracking and predictive analytics.

Data science and machine learning practice for academic datasets.

Output:

CSV file with detailed student grades and averages.

Console summary including top/bottom performers and subject insights.

Fun Fact:
The correlation matrix allows exploration of how subjects relate to one another, which could inspire curriculum improvements or targeted interventions.
